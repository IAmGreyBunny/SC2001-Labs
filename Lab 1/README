RUN THIS ON A SEPARATE FOLDER, AWAY FROM YOUR IMPORTANT FILES.
I'M NOT GOOD AT MAKEFILES, SO I ASKED CHATGPT.
I ASKED FOR A SAFE VERSION OF CLEAN, BUT I CANNOT GUARANTEE ITS 100% SAFE. USE WITH CAUTION.

Requirements: g++ that supports c++17.
If you don't have it, install it.
Guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

Usage:
Open Terminal (Linux/MacOS) or Powershell (Windows).
Navigate to the src folder.

To build, run `make clean all`.
To run, use `make run`. 
Can chain all of them too (so `make clean all run`).

Ignore the virus warnings, antiviruses does that sometimes.
I'm not spreading malware, I promise. The code's all there for you to see?

For more details, read makefile.
